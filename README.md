M- Files: "cvg.m", "webcamcentralshot1.m" and "timerforwebcamcentralshot.m". 


Step 1: For color vector gradient on a single image, the function is "cvg.m". So you can read any image file and run the function on it, and the output image 'Ga' will be the vector gradient image.

Step 2: For video sequence vector gradient analysis, the two functions are "webcamcentralshot1.m" and "timerforwebcamcentralshot.m".

Step 3: Run the main function "webcamcentralshot1.m" while keeping the other file in the same folder, and you should expect a figure with the left subplot being the real-life video feed and the right sub-plot would be the vector gradient video feed.
